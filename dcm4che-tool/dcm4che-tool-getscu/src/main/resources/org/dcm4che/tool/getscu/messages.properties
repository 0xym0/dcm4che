try=Try `getscu --help' for more information.
description=\n\
The getscu application implements a Service Class User (SCU) for the Query/Retrieve, the \
Hanging Protocol Query/Retrieve and the Color Palette Query/Retrieve Service Class. getscu only \
supports retrieve functionality using the C-GET message. It sends matching keys to an Service \
Class Provider (SCP) and waits for responses. Matching keys can be specified in DICOM file(s) \
dcmfile_in or by options -m.
example=-\n\
Examples:\n\
$ getscu -c DCMQRSCP@localhost:11112 -M StudyRoot -L STUDY -m StudyInstanceUID=1.2.3.4 \
--store-tcs resource:common-store-tcs.properties\n-\n\
Retrieve from Query/Retrieve Service Class Provider DCMQRSCP listening on local port 11112 \
the Study with Study Instance UID = 1.2.3.4, negotiating Storage Transfer Capabilities defined \
in resource:common-store-tcs.properties. Retrieved objects are stored to the working directory.
model=specifies Information Model. Supported names: PatientRoot, StudyRoot, PatientStudyOnly, \
CompositeInstanceRoot, HangingProtocol or ColorPalette. If no Information Model is specified, \
StudyRoot will be used.
invalid-model-name={0} is not a supported Information Model name
level=specifies retrieve level. Use STUDY for PatientRoot, StudyRoot, PatientStudyOnly, and \
IMAGE for CompositeInstanceRoot by default.
relational=negotiate relational-retrieve support
explicit-vr=propose all uncompressed TS, explicit VR little endian first \
(default: implicit VR little endian first)
big-endian=propose all uncompressed TS, explicit VR big endian first \
(default: implicit VR little endian first)
implicit-vr=propose only implicit VR little endian \
(default: all uncompressed TS)
match=specify matching key. attr can be specified by keyword or tag value in hex), \
e.g. StudyInstanceUID or 00200000D. Overrides matching keys specified in DICOM file(s). 
store-tc=specifies negotiated Storage Transfer Capability. SOP Class and Transfer Syntaxes can be \
specified by its UID or its name in camel-Case (e.g. 1.2.840.10008.5.1.4.1.1.2 or CTImageStorage). \
Semicolon separated Transfer Syntaxes will be offered in separate Presentation Contexts, where \
comma separated Transfer Syntaxes will be offered in one Presentation Context.
store-tcs=specifies file which defines negotiated Storage Transfer Capabilities. A sample \
configuration file which defines Storage Transfer Capabilities for most common Storage SOP Classes \
and Transfer Syntaxes is provided in resource:common-store-tcs.properties
ignore=do not store retrieved objects in files
directory=directory to which retrieved DICOM Composite Objects are stored, '.' by default
