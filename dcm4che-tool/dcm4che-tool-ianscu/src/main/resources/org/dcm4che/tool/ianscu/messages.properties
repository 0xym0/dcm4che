description=\n\
The ianscu application implements a Service Class User (SCU) for the Instance \
Available Notification (IAN) SOP Class and for the Verification SOP Class. \
DICOM files specified on the command line are scanned and for each different \
Study a IAN N-CREATE referencing the SOP Instances in the scanned files is \
sent to a Service Class Provider (SCP) of the IAN SOP Class. If no DICOM file \
is specified, it sends a DICOM C-ECHO message and waits for a response.\n\-\n\
