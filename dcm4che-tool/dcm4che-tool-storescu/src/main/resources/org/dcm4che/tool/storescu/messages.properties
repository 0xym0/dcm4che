description=\n\
The storescu application implements a Service Class User (SCU) for the Storage \
Service Class and for the Verification SOP Class. For each DICOM file on the \
command line it sends a C-STORE message to a Storage Service Class Provider \
(SCP) and waits for a response. If no DICOM file is specified, it sends a \
DICOM C-ECHO message and waits for a response. The application can be used \
to transmit DICOM images and other DICOM composite objects and to verify \
basic DICOM connectivity.\n\-\n\

Example: storescu -c STORESCP@localhost:11112 image.dcm\n\

listening on local port 11112.
