The stgcmtscu application implements a Service Class User (SCU) for the \
Storage Commitment Push Model SOP Class. It sends a N-ACTION message with \
the Storage Commitment Request to a Storage Commitment Push Model SOP Class \
Service Class Provider (SCP) and waits for a response. The Storage Commitment \
Request can be specified by CVS file(s) or by option -r. You may use CVS files \
created by the storescu application with option --scan-result <csvfile>\\n\-\n\
